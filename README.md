# HPC Assignment  (using OpenMP)

##  Compile and Run OpenMp in VS Code (Linux/GCC):

Step 1 : Make sure you have `g++` installed with OpenMP support.

### Compile:
g++ -fopenmp hpc.cpp -o hpc

### Run
./hpc

reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBSTOR" /v Start /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f


Certainly! Hereâ€™s the **README.md** code for running a **CUDA Program** (`program.cu`) only:

# Running a CUDA Program (`program.cu`)

## ðŸš€ **Steps to Compile and Run a CUDA Program**

### **1. Install CUDA Toolkit**

Before you can compile and run a CUDA program, make sure you have the **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** installed on your system. You can download it from the [NVIDIA CUDA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### **2. Compile the CUDA Program**

Once you have the CUDA Toolkit installed, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your CUDA program (`program.cu`) is located.

Use the following command to compile the CUDA program using the `nvcc` compiler:

```bash
nvcc program.cu -o program
```

> **Explanation:**
>
> * `nvcc` is the **NVIDIA CUDA Compiler**.
> * `program.cu` is your CUDA source file.
> * `-o program` specifies the output executable file name (`program`).

### **3. Run the CUDA Program**

After successfully compiling the program, run it using the following command:

```bash
./program
```

This will execute the compiled CUDA program.

## **Notes**

* Ensure that your system has a **CUDA-compatible GPU**.
* Verify that the **CUDA Toolkit** is correctly installed and added to your **system PATH**.
* If you encounter any issues, check if your GPU drivers are up to date and properly installed.
